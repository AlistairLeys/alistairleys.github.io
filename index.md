# Alistair Leys

<p class="tagline">Data Scientist focused on clear, actionable insight</p>

I design and deliver end-to-end data analysis work that turns complex data into decisions. My approach combines rigorous statistical methods with practical problem-solving to ensure analyses are both technically sound and genuinely useful.

Based in Birmingham, UK, I specialise in predictive modelling and machine learning applications across healthcare, transport, and business domains. I'm seeking data science and AI roles where analytical thinking drives real impact.
