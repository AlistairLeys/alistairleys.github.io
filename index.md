# Alistair Leys

<p class="tagline">Data Scientist focused on clear, actionable insight</p>

I'm a Junior Data Scientist with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence (1st Class, BCU) and practical experience applying machine learning to healthcare, transport, and HR challenges. I specialise in building end-to-end data products that turn complex information into practical business decisions.

My approach combines statistical rigour with pragmatic problem-solving, ensuring analyses are both technically sound and genuinely useful. I've worked with Python, scikit-learn, and SQL to improve patient engagement by 40% in healthcare settings and automated reporting pipelines for traffic analytics. Based in Birmingham, UK, I'm seeking data science roles where analytical thinking drives real impact.

**Current Focus:** Healthcare analytics, predictive modelling, and NLP applications
