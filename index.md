# Alistair Leys

<p class="tagline">Data Scientist focused on clear, actionable insight</p>

I build end-to-end data products that turn complex information into practical business decisions. My approach combines statistical rigour with pragmatic problem-solving, ensuring analyses are both technically sound and genuinely useful.

I care deeply about reproducibility and clear communication. Whether developing predictive models or exploring new datasets, I prioritise methods that stakeholders can understand and trust. Based in Birmingham, UK, I'm open to data and AI roles where analytical thinking drives real impact.
